This actually took me a few hours to accomplish, as I had trouble looking for a domain name host. It also took some time to figure out how to host my static web page's files on the cloud (even following the tutorial I found online was pretty challenging). I ended up using Google Drive to host my files, because Dropbox no longer has Public folders. However, I did save my files as well to github.



Domain host: Dot TK (http://www.dot.tk/en/index.html)

Files host: Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzLljlONXHZWQ2dwdGpmTnlaUDg)

Backup: Github (https://github.com/christinesaavedra/.github.com/tree/master)
